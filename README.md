Problem Statement : You are given a group of philosophers seated at a round table, with a fork to the left and right of each philosopher. To eat spaghetti, a philosopher must hold both forks. However, only one philosopher can hold a fork at a time. If a philosopher tries to pick up a fork that is already being held by another philosopher, they must wait until the fork is released. Your task is to design a program that coordinates the philosophers, ensuring that no philosopher is left waiting indefinitely and that no two philosophers are holding the same fork simultaneously. You should implement a solution using one of the following synchronization mechanisms: locks, semaphores, or monitors. Your program should also include a mechanism to test the correctness of your solution, such as printing debug information or using assertions to verify that the forks are being accessed correctly.
